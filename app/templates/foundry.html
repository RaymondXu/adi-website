        <h3>ADI Foundry is an opportunity for you to give back to the community with your computer science skills. At Foundry, you'll be working on projects for civic tech organizations and get the opportunity to plan, write, and ship code for a client - an experience that you won't be able to find elsewhere at Columbia. At the end of the year, you'll get to see your code impact the lives of potentially thousands of Americans.
